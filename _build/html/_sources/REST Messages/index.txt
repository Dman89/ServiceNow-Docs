REST Message v2
##########################


External Cart Orders
********************

Sending the REST Message
========================

* From within another ServiceNow Instance

    This can be run however you would want, but I've only tested
    this using a background script.  I don't see why it would
    not work otherwise.


.. code-block:: javascript

    var request = new sn_ws.RESTMessageV2();
    request.setEndpoint('https://devXXXXX.service-now.com/api/now/table/u_cart_order');
    request.setHttpMethod('POST');

    //Eg. UserName="admin", Password="admin" for this code sample.
    var user = 'admin';
    var password = 'admin';

    request.setBasicAuth(user,password);
    request.setRequestHeader("Accept","application/json");
    request.setRequestHeader('Content-Type','application/json');
    request.setRequestBody("{\"u_catolog_item\":\"e46305bdc0a8010a00645e608031eb0f\"," +
                                "\"u_variables\":\"cpu_speed=3000," +
                                "\""
                                "replacement=Yes\"}");
    var response = request.execute();
    gs.log(response.getBody());
