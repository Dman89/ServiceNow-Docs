Time Card Modifications
====================================================

Generate Time Cards based on Resource Allocations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Currently timecards are only generated for the table planned_task and only for the current week

Goal
------

  * Generate timecards when the current user is assigned as a resource allocation
  * Generate timecards for upcoming weeks (not just the current week)

Script Include
---------------

  The only script we need to edit is the **TimeCardAjax** script include.  Since this is OOB, it's best to insert-and-stay
  then mark the original as inactive.

  The only OOB function we will be editing is **ajaxFunction_generateTaskCards()**, the rest we will be creating
  ourselves.

    .. code-block:: javascript

        ajaxFunction_generateTaskCards: function(){
          //get request info
          this.weekStart = this._getWeekStart();
          this.user = this.getParameter('sysparm_user');
          this.weekEnd = this._getWeekEnd();
          this.newCards = []; //list of cards created
          this.existingCards = this._getExistingCards();
          this.plannedTasks = this._getPlannedTasks();
          this._generateMissingCards(this.plannedTasks);
          this._generateMissingCards(this.tasks);

          //added two functions to be run for Resource Allocations
          this.resourceAllocations = this._getResourceAllocations();
          this._generateMissingAllocations();
              
           this._buildResult();
        },

  This is the function that gets run initially, when TimecardAjax is called.  What I added were two lines between *this._generateMissingCards(this.plannedTasks)**
  and **this._buildResult();**.  

  Both functions should be self explanatory.  The **._getResourceAllocation()** grabs all resource allocations for the user
  and **._generateMissingAllocations()** will generate timecards if there are no timecards associated.
